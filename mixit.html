  <H1>MIXIT</h1>
<p>MIXIT is a program that reads various image and stream files of various formats and combines
them into a single image of the same or different output format according to various
options provided as parameters on the input and output filenames.
Each input file is converted and either appended or overlayed to the 
output file depending on the output file type.
</p>
  <p>NOTE: The behavior of this program with respect to filename handling might not be what one is used to.
  Back in the old days under RT11, VAX/VMS and perhaps even MSDOS, file formats were identified by filetypes. Even today under
  Windows the filetypes are sometimes hidden (a big mistake if you ask me but nobody has) and used to determine what's expected to be in the file.
  The user sometimes need not specify a filename including the filetype (extension) where the application might
  easily deduce the filetype. As a result that same paradigm was programmed into mixit. If no filetype on a filename is provided one will be defaulted and this
  might not be what the user wants. Just beware. And since this application was first developed under RT11 then again under VAX/VMS, the filetypes and
  commands and examples shown in this document are in uppercase. If the O/S upon which this application is running respects the case of filenames+filetypes,
  one must use its rules.
  </p>
  <p>A little history of this program. A version of this application was written in PDP-11 assembly in the late 1970's on a computer running RT-11 for
  the coin-operated video game division of Atari. It continued to be used even after coin-op began using VAX/VMS in the early 1980's. In the late 1980's or early 1990's
  a new version was started and written in the C language, first for the VAX then later ported to various operating systems in use in the coin-op labs at the time.
  The C version evolved over time and by 1998 any further changes stopped. By then little need remained for use of this application.
  What remained of the coin-op division closed up shop in April 2003.

  <em>Note from Dave Shepperd, 8/2022
  <p>
  There never were any release notes kept on this application so there is no record of what got changed when. It just is what it is.
  Although I wrote the RT11 version and I might have also written a version in VAX/VMS assembly too at one point, I don't recall. I did not write this C version but did
    specify what it should do in order to be compatible with existing .mix files and scripts. Lyle Rains and Jim Petrick wrote this version in 'C'.
    </p>
    <p>
    It always had some annoying bugs (there were workarounds) and recently I got involved in rebuilding some of old Atari coin-op game code (some of which recently
    released on github) and needed this tool to make ROM/EPROM images to use with MAME. So I visited this code base and fixed a few of the bugs
    that annoyed me the most. I also removed the code that handled the ELF input format since the sources (just .h files) for that code included items marked with
    various corporate copyright disallowing distribution. I did take the opportunity to format into HTML the little documentation there was describing how to use MIXIT. I
    am not a technical writer nor am I good at HTML5 and quickly lose interest in writing technical documents so good luck making sense of anything written here.
    Feel free to hack this document into something more readable. If you do, please send me a copy.

  <p>where [] indicates optional items.</p>
  <pre>
  <b>-?</b> = display a help message.
  <b>-h</b> = display a help message.
  <b>-d</b> = set debug mode. It causes lots of messages.
  <b>-q</b> = unset verbose mode. Quiet mode is the default.
  <b>-v</b> = set verbose mode. It causes some messages.

  <p>
  If a command_file is provided, all the commands will be taken from it. It has a default filetype of <b>.MIX</b> (or <b>.mix</b>) Otherwise it will
  prompt for interactive input. The contents of the file is plain text with one command per line the syntax being exactly the same as
  that for interactive.
  </p>
<h2>Filetypes</h2>

<p>The input and output file format is selected by the filename extension
specified (aka filetype). The following formats are currently supported. Those shown with <b>(I/O)</b> are accepted
  for both input and output. Those showing <b>(O only)</b> can only be used for output.
The default filetype (if none specified) for both input and output is .LDA. The
filetypes, if defaulted, are expected to be lowercase on *nix systems.

<h2>Commands</h2>
MIXIT is run by a list of commands executed in the order that they are 
encountered. These commands can come either from the user's terminal or
from a command file.

<h3 id="OutCmd">OUTPUT command</h3>

<p>
  The output command must appear before any <a href="#InCmd">INPUT</a> commands. This command 
specifies the name of the output file and any optional attributes. Each 
occurance of an <b>OUTPUT</b> command causes <b>MIXIT</b> to clear all buffers and 
counters in preparation for subsequent <a href="#InCmd">INPUT</a> files.
</p>
  <code>OUTPUT filename [/attributes...]</code>
  <p>
  The attributes are delimited from the filename and each other either with a <b>/</b> or <b>-</b> (dash) depending on the operating system. For Windows/DOS/RT11/VMS it is <b>/</b>,
  for the others it is a dash <b>-</b>. A whitespace will be required on systems with the delimiter of dash.
  </p>
<h4>Output command attributes</h4>
<h5>/FILL=x</h5>
<p>
Fill specifies a value to use to fill all unused or uninitialised bytes in 
the output file. The defaut for ASCII and stream binary files is for
uninitialised bytes to remain uninitialised. The default for image mode 
files is uninititalised bytes to be set to 0. If the FILL character is 
specified, all uninitialised bytes in all ouput file types are set to
that value. The parameter <b>x</b> is assumed to be a HEXADECIMAL number
but can be expressed as either a decimal or octal number by prefixing a %D or %O to it
respectively. Only the data bytes residing between the specified low and
high address limits are filled. Use caution with this option when trying
to overlay ASCII and binary type files because the fill may overlay
previously written data. 
</p>
<h5>/MODE=x</h5>
<p>
Mode specifies the type of output addressing that should be used. It 
basically specifies whether or not the output load addresses are 
relative to bytes or to words. Hence the <b>x</b> parameter can be
  either the text <b>WORD</b> or <b>BYTE</b> (the default). This 
option should only be used when creating an output file for hardware 
that is NOT byte addressable. For example, if you had to create an .LDA
file to be loaded by a 32 bit processor that could only address to the 
granularity of 32 bit words, you would specify <b>/MODE=WORD/WORD_SIZE=32</b>.
There would then be 4 bytes of data for each address specified by the
.LDA file load address argument.
</p>
<h5>/WORD_SIZE=n</h5>
<p>
Word_size specifies the size of each output word in bits.
The argument <b>n</b> is assumed to be a DECIMAL number but can be expressed
as hex or octal by prefixing a %X or %O respectively. The default word 
size is 8.  It can only resolve to one of (decimal) 8, 16, 24 or 32.
</p>
<h5>/GROUP=n</h5>
<p>
Group specifies which group of 8 bits (i.e. the byte number) in the word to
output. This allows you create an output file that only contains every
<b>nth</b> byte of the input file(s). Useful, for example, when one has to
seperate the high and low bytes of 16 bit programs into seperate files. 
This option is only significant for word sizes greater than 8 bits. The
<b>n</b> is a DECIMAL number indicating the BYTE number relative to 0 in
  the word to include in the output. For example: <b>/WORD_SIZE=24/GROUP=2</b> would cause 
only every 3rd byte to be included in the output file. The only valid numbers
  for <b>n</b> is 0, 1, 2 or 3.
</p>
<h5>/RECORD_SIZE=n</h5>
<p>
Specifies an alternate output record size. Each output type has a maximum
length that will not be exceeded regardless of what is specified. The
defaults and maximums are:
</p>
  <table style="width: 20%">
    <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Default</th>
    <th>Maximum</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>.ROM</td><td>16</td><td>80</td></tr>
    <tr><td>.ASM</td><td>16</td><td>80</td></tr>
    <tr><td>.MAC</td><td>16</td><td>80</td></tr>
    <tr><td>.HEX</td><td>32</td><td>121</td></tr>
    <tr><td>.DLD</td><td>32</td><td>121</td></tr>
    <tr><td>.INTEL</td><td>32</td><td>121</td></tr>
    <tr><td>.MOT</td><td>32</td><td>121</td></tr>
    <tr><td>.LDA</td><td>249</td><td>512</td></tr>
    <tr><td>.VLDA</td><td>505</td><td>505</td></tr>
    <tr><td>.DIO</td><td>256</td><td>256</td></tr>
    <tr><td>.CPE</td><td>503</td><td>503</td></tr>
    <tr><td>all others</td><td>256</td><td>512</td></tr>
  </table>
<p>
The <b>n</b> is the DECIMAL length in data bytes to make the output records.
</p>
<h5>/ONES_COMPLEMENT</h5>
<p>
Ones_compliment specifies that the data bytes are to be 1's complemented as they are
written to the output file. This option is for custom hardware that needs inverted
  bits when reading from the PROM/ROM/EPROM.
</p>
<h3 id="inCmd">INPUT command</h4>
<p>
The input command must appear after an <a href="%outCmd">OUTPUT</a> command has
  been specified. The <b>INPUT</b> command specifies the filename and attributes
  of a file to read, reposition and deposit in the output file either by appending
  or overlaying it. The format is:
</p>
	<code><b>INPUT file_name[.type] [/attributes...]</b></code>
<p>
where <b>file_name</b> is any filepath and the default filetype <b>.type</b> is .LDA (or .lda depending on the O/S).
If no attributes are specified, the whole file is used and the position
in the output file is assumed to be the same as found in the input. 
(I.e. if the input addresses run from 1000-1FFF, the data will be placed 
in the output at 1000-1FFF.)
</p>
  <h4>Input command attributes</h4>
<h5>/ADDRESS=sss[:eee[:ooo]]</h5>
  <p>
Specifies the range of addresses to input and where to position the data 
in the output file. The <b>ssss</b> indicates in HEX the starting address,
  <b>eeee</b> indicates the LAST address to use (i.e. inclusive) and
  <b>oooo</b> indicates where to position the data in the output file.
  All arguments can be 32 bit values and can be expressed in decimal or
  octal by prefixing a %D or %O in front of the number respectively.
  There is an alternate form for this command:
  </p>
	<code><b>/ADDRESS=([START=sss],[END=eee],[OUTPUT=ooo])</b></code>
  <p>
  The order of arguments is not significant in the long form.
  The default <b>ssss</b> in this case is the lowest address found in the file;
  the default <b>eeee</b> is the highest address found in the file and
  the default <b>oooo</b> is the place to begin the deposit into the output.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some examples:
  </p>
  <pre>
	INPUT foo.bar <b>/ADD=1800</b>         ;from 1800 to end of file
	INPUT foo.bar <b>/ADD=1800:18FF</b>    ;256 bytes from 1800 to 18FF
	INPUT foo.bar <b>/ADDR=1800:1FFF:0</b> ;reposition 2k bytes to 0
	INPUT foo.bar <b>/ADDR=(ST=8000,EN=FFFF,OUT=7FFF)</b> ;back the whole file up 1 byte
	INPUT foo.bar <b>/ADDR=(OUT=1000)</b>  ;reposition whole file to 1000
  </pre>
<h5>/MODE=x</h5>
<p>
Mode specifies the type of input addressing that should be used. It 
basically specifies whether or not the input load addresses are 
relative to bytes or to words. Hence the <b>x</b> parameter can be
  either the text <b>WORD</b> or <b>BYTE</b> (the default). If the
  input file was created by a system that expected, for example, each
  MAU (minimum addressable unit) was 32 bits wide, specify <b>/MODE=WORD/WORD_SIZE=32</b>.
It would mean there would be 4 bytes of data for each address specified by the
record in the input file.
</p>
<h5>/WORD_SIZE=n</h5>
<p>
Word_size specifies the size of each input word in bits.
The argument <b>n</b> is assumed to be a DECIMAL number but can be expressed
as hex or octal by prefixing a %X or %O respectively. The default word 
size is 8.  The <b>n</b>parameter can resolve only to one of (decimal) 8, 16, 24 or 32.
</p>
<h5>/GROUP=n</h5>
<p>
Group specifies which group of 8 bits (i.e. the byte number) in the word to
output. This allows you create an output file that only contains every
<b>nth</b> byte of the input file(s). Useful, for example, when one has to
seperate the high and low bytes of 16 bit programs into seperate files. 
This option is only significant for word sizes greater than 8 bits. The
<b>n</b> is a DECIMAL number indicating the BYTE number relative to 0 in
  the word to include in the output. For example: <b>/WORD_SIZE=24/GROUP=2</b> would cause 
only every 3rd byte to be included in the output file. The only valid numbers
  for <b>n</b> are 0, 1, 2 or 3.
</p>
<h5>/FILL=x</h5>
<p>
Fill specifies a value to use to fill all unused or uninitialised bytes in 
the output file but only within the lowest and highest addresses found in the
  specified input file. The defaut for ASCII and stream binary files is for
uninitialised bytes to remain uninitialised. The default for image mode 
files is uninititalised bytes to be set to 0. If the FILL character is 
specified, all uninitialised bytes in all ouput file types are set to
that value. The parameter <b>x</b> is assumed to be a HEXADECIMAL number
but can be expressed as either a decimal or octal number by prefixing a %D or %O to it
respectively. Only the data bytes residing between the specified low and
high address limits (if any) are filled. Use caution with this option when trying
to overlay ASCII and binary type files because the fill may overlay
previously written data.

  <p>
Returns control back to the O/S.
  </p>
  <p>
  NOTE: Some stream text output files require a footer to be written after all
  the normal records have been written. One would be wise to always use EXIT to
  quit MIXIT instead of Control-C or some other method to quit.

  If one wants to program a 27512 with 4 16k blocks of data from 4 
  seperate files, one might do it this way:

    <p>
    Extended TEKHEX format records.
    </p>
    <p>
    The data is recorded as a series of ASCII records. The
    format of the records is as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
    %cctssvvdddd....dd
    </pre>
    <p>
    where "%" is the record sentinel, "cc" is the count of the
    number of ascii bytes in the record (excluding the '%'
    sentinel), "t" is the record type (3 = symbol, 6=data, 8=termination),
    "ss" is the 8 bit checksum of all the binary nibbles in the
    record (except the "%" and the "ss" bytes, but including
    cc and t), "vv" is a variable length field containing the
    load address of the data byte to follow and "dd" is the data
    bytes. The variable length field format is: cd...d where
    "c" is the number of ascii chars that follow (0-F where 0 =
    16 decimal, 1 = 1, etc.) and "d" is the number to
    represent. I.e. "3421" expands to hex 0421. The minimum
    field width is 2 bytes and the maximum is 17 bytes
    (including the count byte).  All values are expressed in
    hex and there is 1 ASCII character for each 4 bit nibble.

  <h3 id="DIO_Format">DIO file format</h3>
    <pre>
    Data I/O - Raw data.  There are three formats of DIO data.
  
    1)  An initial RUBOUT (FF) character begins the data, followed by 
    sequential bytes of data starting from address 0.  The data ends at EOF.
  
    2)  16-bit mode, where the format is:
  
    08,1C,2A,49,08,00,cccc,FF,data...,00,00,ssss
  
    where cccc is the 2-byte count of data,
    and   ssss is the 2-byte checksum.
  
    3)  32-bit mode, where the format is:
  
    08,1C,3E,6B,08,00,cccccccc,FF,data...,00,00,ssss
  
    where cccccccc is the 4-byte count of data,
    and       ssss is the 2-byte checksum.
  
  
    On the VAX, all the DIO files begin with a CR, then the 15-byte header,
    etc.

	What does this all mean?  Mostly the file has data_commands.  They
	define how memory should be filled.  Data gets put in memory starting
	at start_address, and optionally duplicated through end_address.  If
	increment is specified, it defines how much to bump the address between
	data items.  Wildcards allow huge ranges of data to be written with
	only a few commands.
</p>
  <p>
	Data_expression defines a list of data items to put into memory according
	to the address expression.  Wildcards here specify 'do not touch' areas
	that are not written over.  A data_expression that is shorter than the
	address_expression range will be repeated until the range has been filled.
</p>
  <p>
	Spaces and tabs are ignored anywhere in the line, and anything on the
	line after a ';' is considered a comment and stripped out prior to 
	parsing.
</p>
  <p> Some simple examples of the contents of a .ROM file:</p>
  <pre>
  00=0,1,2,3    ;Sets location 0 through 3 in output to 0,1,2,3
  04=A,B,C,D    ;Sets location 4 through 7 in output to 0A,0B,0C,0D
  100=AB,CD,EF  ;Sets location 0x100 through 0x102 to 0xAB, 0xCD, 0xEF
  20:27=4,5,6   ;Sets location 0x20-0x27 to 4,5,6,4,5,6,4,5
  40=1,2,X,XX,3 ;Sets 0x40=1, 0x41=1 and 0x44=3 but leaves locations 0x42 and 0x43 unchanged.
  100='00001111 ;Sets location 0x100 to 0x0F
  101='xx000xxx ;Sets bits 5,4 and 3 to 0 at location 0x101 but leaves other bits unchanged

    CPE - variable length binary stream data as used on the Sony
      playstation. Each record is identified by a leading byte in the
      range 0 to 8 indicating the record type. The types are defined
      as:
  
        0 = EOF (End of File)
        1 = n bytes of data to be loaded at m address.
          the address (m) is 4 bytes following immediately
          after the type byte, lsb first (little endian);
          the count (n) is 4 bytes following immediately
          after the address, lsb first (little endian);
          the data follows immediately after the count.
        2 = xfer address. 4 bytes, lsb first, follows immediately
          after the type byte.
        3 = set register n to long value v. Register number is 2 bytes,
          lsb first, following immediately after the type byte;
          value (v) is 4 bytes, lsb first, following immediately
          after the register number.
        4 = set register n to word value v. Register number is 2 bytes,
          lsb first, following immediately after the type byte;
          value (v) is 2 bytes, lsb first, following immediately
          after the register number.
        5 = set register n to byte value v. Register number is 2 bytes,
          lsb first, following immediately after the type byte;
          value (v) is 1 byte following immediately after the
          register number.
        6 = set register n to 3-byte value v. Register number is 2 bytes,
          lsb first, following immediately after the type byte;
          value (v) is 3 bytes, lsb first, following immediately
          after the register number.
        7 = workspace address is 4 bytes, lsb first, following immediately
          after the type byte.
        8 = unit number is 1 byte following immediately after the type
          byte.
